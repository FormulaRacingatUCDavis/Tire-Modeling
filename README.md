# TireModeling
Tire Model Generation Software and Resulting Models

This repo stores FRUCD scripts and results relating to the modeling of tire mechanics. This is predominantly the tire modeling script that converts raw CalSpan Tire Data (.mat) to a standard MATLAB class instance (FRUCDTire) which may be used in vehicle modeling platforms.
